										<h2><a href="#">Project 1<br />
										Operation SPARTAN SHIELD </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Operation Spartan Shield is a disaster recovery plan we customized for our trusted client in the Aviation Industry. Our mission was to minimize downtime and get the organization back up and running as quickly as possible. The first steps in creating this disaster recovery plan was to assess the risks that the organization faced at the time. This included identifying the potential disasters that could occur, such as natural disasters, data breaches, or hardware failures, and evaluating their likelihood and impact on the organization.</p>
									<p> In The next steps, we conducted a business impact analysis to determine which business functions and systems were critical to the organization's operations. This helped us prioritize the recovery efforts and ensure that the most important systems were restored first. Based on the risk assessment and business impact analysis, we were able to define the strategy for recovering critical business functions and systems. This included using backup systems, failover to a secondary site, and using cloud-based services.</p>
									<p> During our cloud health checks, we regularly tested and drilled the disaster recovery plan to ensure that it was effective and that all organization team members were familiar with their roles and responsibilities. For transparency purposes, the disaster recovery plan included a communication plan for informing employees, customers, and other stakeholders about the disaster and the recovery efforts. Finally, we Maintain and update The disaster recovery plan regularly to reflect changes in the organization's technology, processes, and business objectives.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Project 2 <br />
											operation Beaver Cage</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The mission for this operation was simple! we just needed to protect sensitive financial data and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements whilst designing and implementing the security solution for our client in the financial industry.</p>
									<p>First off, we identified the regulatory requirements that the company must comply with which included requirements related to data protection, cybersecurity, and financial reporting. We were able to assess current security and compliance posture in order to identify any gaps or weaknesses that needed to be addressed. This included conducting a security assessment and a compliance assessment</p>
									<p>Based on the regulatory requirements and the current security and compliance posture at the time, we were able to define the security and compliance requirements for the cloud-based solution. This included both technical requirements, such as encryption and access controls, as well as process-related requirements, such as incident response and data handling procedures.</p>
									<p>Per the organizational requirements we configured some security controls whilst integrating with on-premises systems, and implementing processes for managing and monitoring the solution. Once the solution was implemented, we continously tested and validated the system to ensure that it meets all of the security and compliance requirements. This included conducting penetration tests, security assessments, and other types of testing</p>
									<p>Lastly our service included Ongoing maintenance updates which i believe was critical to ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of the cloud-based security and compliance solution. This included applying security patches, monitoring for potential vulnerabilities, and updating processes and procedures as needed.</p>
